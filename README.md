# Rust-activities
This is my work on the Rust 101 crash course from Zero to mastery Youtube video. 
here is the link to the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzKeecy4OmQ
Due to all the activities being in one directory and my inexperience to using Cargo. 
I came up with a solution to running each activity in a loop from the main.rs file.
Essentially making a cli menu.
All code may be re-used if desired as the material is in the public domain.
